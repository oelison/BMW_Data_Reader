# BMW_Data_Reader
Read the BMW connected drive data from the website

Based on https://www.active-tourer-forum.de/index.php/Thread/1231-Auslesen-der-BMW-Daten-mit-FHEM-225xe/?pageNo=4

Actually the data only will be read from the BMW-Site. Parsing and statistics will be done later. (maybe a different Tool)
